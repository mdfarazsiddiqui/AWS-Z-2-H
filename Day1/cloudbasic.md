<!-- What is Cloud -->

# Before Cloud, Traditionally most of the companies have their own data centers that they bought from some server provider company like IBM. They are very costly, you need your own infrastructure, wastage is alot if your app is using only 20% of cpu and memory resources then 80% goes into wastage as it is unused.

<!-- To Avoid Wastage Virtualization is Introduced -->

# Virtualization, in simple terms, is a technology that allows you to create multiple "virtual" versions of computers or servers on a single physical machine. It's like having several computers inside a single box.

# Here's a simple analogy: Think of a virtualization software as a magician's hat. The hat (the physical server) can hold multiple rabbits (virtual machines) inside it. Each rabbit (virtual machine) is like a separate computer with its own operating system, applications, and settings. However, all these virtual machines share the resources of the single physical server.
